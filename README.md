*A rock-solid, high-performance Python core for metamorphic image manipulation.*

---

## About The Project

In software development, handling fundamental image tasks like batch conversion, intelligent renaming, or optimization can often feel fragmented and require multiple libraries. **Gneiss-Engine** is being built to solve this by providing a single, powerful, and reliable core for all common image processing needs.

The name "Gneiss" (pronounced /na…™s/, like "nice") is inspired by the metamorphic rock, which is formed when existing rocks are fundamentally transformed under immense heat and pressure. In the same spirit, Gneiss-Engine is designed as a foundational toolkit that **re-forms and restructures** your image assets, providing a solid, layered foundation for all manipulation tasks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: A Hobby Project in Early Development

**Please be aware:** This project is currently in its early conceptual and development stages. It is **not yet ready for production use**, and the API is subject to change without notice.

More importantly, **Gneiss-Engine is a personal hobby project**. It is developed and maintained by an individual solely in their spare time. This means that while the project is a labor of love, **development progress will be slow**. Your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated!

We welcome ideas, feedback, and future contributors to help shape its direction.

## ‚ú® Core Features (Vision)

Gneiss-Engine is being designed with the following key capabilities in mind:

*   **üîÑ Metamorphic Conversion:** A simple and powerful API for converting images between various formats (e.g., `PNG`, `JPEG`, `WEBP`, `AVIF`), akin to a rock changing its fundamental structure.
*   **‚úçÔ∏è Intelligent Renaming:** Advanced batch renaming capabilities based on custom patterns, sequential numbering, or even image metadata (like EXIF data).
*   **üîç High-Quality Resizing:** Easy-to-use functions for scaling images while maintaining aspect ratio and image quality.
*   **üíß Watermarking:** A fluent interface to add text or image-based watermarks with control over opacity, position, and tiling.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Metadata Management:** The ability to easily read, write, and strip image metadata (EXIF, IPTC, etc.).
*   **‚ö° Performance-Focused:** Built on top of highly optimized libraries (like Pillow-SIMD) to ensure speed is a primary feature.

## üöÄ Our Philosophy

1.  **Simplicity First:** We believe powerful tools don't have to be complicated. Gneiss-Engine will feature a clean, chainable, and highly readable API.
2.  **Extensibility:** Designed as a core "engine," it will be easy to extend with custom plugins and functionality.
3.  **Reliability:** A strong focus on comprehensive testing and predictable behavior. It should be the bedrock of your image processing pipeline.

## Hypothetical Usage (What We're Aiming For)

Here is a sneak peek at what using Gneiss-Engine might look like. *Note: This is a conceptual example and the final API may differ.*

```python
# The package name might be simply 'gneiss' for elegance
from gneiss import Image

# A simple, fluent API for chainable operations
try:
    Image("path/to/source_image.jpg")
        .resize(width=1024)
        .add_watermark("logo.png", position="bottom_right", opacity=0.7)
        .to_format("webp", quality=90)
        .save("path/to/output/new_image.webp")
    
    print("Image processed successfully!")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## How to Contribute

We are not yet accepting pull requests for features, but we are extremely open to ideas and discussions! If you have a suggestion, find a bug in our early code, or want to be a part of the project's future, please **open an issue** on GitHub.

Your feedback during this crucial initial phase is invaluable.
